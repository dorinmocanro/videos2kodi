# videos2kodi
This is a program that will get all vidoes , especially tv show and rename them acording to kodi. (ps: you will have to manually introduce in database the new movie name) . It will create a folder with link-names acording to kodi naming-convention. if you have movies that are read-only, then this program is for you.
this has a limitation in that mklink will not create hard links on other hard-drives (harddrive must be the same as the file)
